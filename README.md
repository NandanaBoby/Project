### Project Documentation
For Software:
Overview
The Audio Analysis Program is a web-based application that analyzes real-time audio input from the user's microphone, visualizes the waveform, and displays humorous roast messages periodically. It utilizes the Web Audio API to achieve audio processing and rendering.

Purpose
The program is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate audio processing techniques using JavaScript and the Web Audio API. It can be used as a fun interactive tool for users to visualize sound levels and enjoy playful messages.

Features
Real-time audio level measurement in decibels.
Visualization of audio waveform on an HTML canvas.
Periodic display of roast messages based on audio levels.
Responsive user interface with buttons for starting and stopping audio measurement.
Architecture
Components
HTML: Provides the structure of the user interface.
CSS: Styles the application for a better user experience.
JavaScript: Implements the core functionality, including audio processing, waveform visualization, and message handling.
Detailed Description of Components
HTML (index.html)
Contains buttons for starting and stopping audio measurement.
Includes a <canvas> element for visualizing the audio waveform.
A modal for displaying roast messages.
CSS (style.css)
Basic styles to enhance the layout and appearance (optional, can be customized).
JavaScript (script.js)
Implements core functionalities, divided into several functions:
startMeasuring(): Initializes audio context, connects to the microphone, and starts audio analysis.
stopMeasuring(): Stops audio input and closes the audio context.
measureSound(): Continuously measures sound levels and updates the display and waveform.
startRoastTimer(): Sets a timer to display a roast message at random intervals.
displayRoastMessage(): Displays a randomly selected roast message in a modal.
closeModal(): Closes the modal and resumes audio measurement.
drawWaveform(data): Renders the audio waveform on the canvas.
Usage
Prerequisites
A modern web browser that supports the Web Audio API (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
Microphone access must be granted in the browser.
How to Run the Program
Download or Clone the Repository: Obtain the source code.
Open index.html in a Web Browser: You can double-click the file or serve it using a local server.
Start Measuring: Click the "Start" button to begin audio analysis.
View Decibel Levels: The decibel level will update in real-time.
Enjoy Roast Messages: Every 30 to 40 seconds, a roast message will appear, pausing audio measurement temporarily.
Stop Measuring: Click the "Stop" button to halt audio input.
Example Interaction
User clicks "Start".
Audio levels are measured, and the waveform is drawn.
After a period, a roast message like "You're about as useful as a screen door on a submarine." appears.
User can click "Close" to dismiss the message and resume audio measurement.
Testing
Audio Measurement: Test with varying sound levels to ensure accurate decibel readings.
Waveform Visualization: Check that the waveform updates appropriately with sound input.
Message Display: Verify that roast messages appear at the designated intervals.
Compatibility
The application works on modern browsers that support the Web Audio API.
Ensure microphone permissions are granted to allow audio input.
Troubleshooting
Microphone Not Detected: Ensure permissions are granted in the browser settings.
Waveform Not Updating: Check for any JavaScript errors in the browser console.
Messages Not Displaying: Verify that the roast timer is correctly set.
Future Enhancements
Add more interactive features, such as user-customizable roast messages.
Enhance the waveform visualization with additional audio frequency analysis.
Implement a mobile-friendly design for better accessibility on smartphones.
